# Applied Data Science Capstone
Hello and Welcome to IBM Applied Data Science Capstone Course repository

In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

# Module 1 Overview:
We will be provided with an overview of the problem and the tools you need to complete the course.
## Objectives:
- Develop Python code to manipulate data in a Pandas data frame
- Convert a JSON file into a Create a Python Pandas data frame by converting a JSON file
- Create a Jupyter notebook and make it sharable using GitHub
- Utilize data science methodologies to define and formulate a real-world business problem
- Utilize your data analysis tools to load a dataset, clean it, and find out interesting insights from it

# Module 2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We will collect data on the Falcon 9 first-stage landings. We will use a RESTful API and web scraping. We will also convert the data into a dataframe and then perform some data wrangling.
## Objectives:
- Create scatter plots and bar charts by writing Python code to analyze data in a Pandas data frame
- Write Python code to conduct exploratory data analysis by manipulating data in a Pandas data frame
- Create and execute SQL queries to select and sort data
- Utilize your data visualization skills to visualize the data and extract meaningful patterns to guide the modeling process

# Module 3 Interactive Visual Analytics and Dashboard
We will build a dashboard to analyze launch records interactively with Plotly Dash. We will then build an interactive map to analyze the launch site proximity with Folium.
## Objectives:
- Build an interactive dashboard that contains pie charts and scatter plots to analyze data with the Plotly Dash Python library.
- Calculate distances on an interactive map by writing Python code using the Folium library.
- Generate interactive maps, plot coordinates, and mark clusters by writing Python code using the Folium library.
- Build a dashboard to analyze launch records interactively with Plotly Dash.
- Build an interactive map to analyze the launch site proximity with Folium.
